Use the below reference links to understand how to calculate CLV and write a 
report on visiting Tim Hortons.

You started drinking coffee from Tim Hortonâ€™s since January 2020 an average you 
spend $6.45 each visit 3 time during the week to Tim Hortons till now. Calculate 
CLV.

Libraries
```{r}

library("dplyr")

library("readr")

library("ggplot2")

library("tidyverse")
```


DATA:

Average sale=$6.45
```{r}
avg_sale<-6.45
```

Average visit=3/week
```{r}
visit_week<-3
```

Total number of years since january 2020 until 2023
```{r}
years<-3
```

Customer Lifetime Value formula:
CLV= Acerage purchage value*average purchage frequency*average customer lifespam

Calculate the number of visit in 1 year to complete the data considering 50 weeks per year

```{r}
visits_year<-visit_week*50
```

Replace the data in the formula 
CLV = $6.45 (average purchase) * 150 (annual visits) * 3(years)

```{r}
clv<-round((avg_sale*visits_year*years),2)

print(clv)
```

2. Using the profit margin of 25% to get a more accurate CLV

```{r}
profit<-0.25
```

Now we reeplace the information with the profit in the formula
CLV_prof = $6.45 (average purchase) * 150 (annual visits) * 3(years) * 0.25(profit)

```{r}
clv_prof<-round((avg_sale*visits_year*years*profit),2)

print (round(clv_prof,2))
```


3. Evaluate the CLV for following customer

First we charge the data in RStudio
```{r}

customer_eval<- read_csv("customer_eval.csv")
```

Check the data
```{r}
head(customer_eval)
```

All NA are removed since the dataset has many empty columns. 
Eliminate  missing values
```{r}
customer_eval <- na.omit(customer_eval)
```

Create new variable Total Price since the dataset shows us the unit price and the quantity
```{r}
customer_eval$Tot_Price <- (customer_eval$Quantity*customer_eval$UnitPrice)

head(customer_eval)
```



Evaluate by customer ID
```{r}
Eval_CustomID<-customer_eval %>% 
  group_by(CustomerID) %>% 
  summarise(Tot_Price = sum(Tot_Price))

print(Eval_CustomID)
```


Evaluate by Invoice No
```{r}
Eval_Invoice<-customer_eval %>% 
  group_by(InvoiceNo) %>% 
  summarise(Tot_Price = sum(Tot_Price))

print(Eval_Invoice)
```

CLV by ARPU calculation
```{r}
clv_customeval<-round((sum(customer_eval$Tot_Price)/ length(unique(customer_eval$CustomerID))))

print(clv_customeval)
```
